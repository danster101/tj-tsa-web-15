        <h3>History</h3>
        
        <h4>Pre-2012</h4>
        
        <p>TJ had some attempts to begin TSA chapters in the past.  However, most of them only lasted a single year before disbanding.</p>
        
        <h4>2012</h4>
        
        <p>The current TJHSST TSA Chapter was founded in 2012 by Lucas Lin and Kyle Hernodon. Future officers Matthew Savage and Danial Hussain aided in setting up the club to be able to compete that same school year at the regional, state, and national level.</p>
        
        <h4>2013</h4>
        
        <p>The chapter's first tests of its ability came in 2013 with the Northern Regional Fair and Technosphere.  TJ TSA took home 13 each at the Regional Fair and at Technosphere.  TJ's Rohan Pandit won <i>Most Competitive Technosphere Participant</i>, and the school as a whole won the <i>Arvid W. Van Dyke Outstanding School Award</i>.</p>
        
        <p>Seven of TJ TSA's members made the trip to Orlando for the National Conference in June 2013.  The team had a handful of finalist finishes and a single trophy, won by Matthew Barbano for Future Technology Teacher.</p>

        <p>When the TSA season began again in fall 2013, the chapter had gained much popularity and had established itself as a highly competitive club.  Unlike the previous year, a strict applications process was used to determine members, and about 30% of applicants were rejected, producing a competing team of about 34 students.  The chapter also had a different sponsor and meeting location than the previous year.</p>
        
        <h4>2014</h4>
        
        <p>TJ TSA delivered once again at the 2014 Northern Regional Fair, bringing home 18 trophies and 31 finalist finishes, notably including a first-second-third sweep in Debating Technological Issues.</p>
