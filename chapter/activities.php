<h3>Chapter Activities</h3>

<h4>J-Day</h4>

<p>Every June Thomas Jefferson HS has a one day celebration known as Jefferson Day or J-Day! There are very short classes, giving Student Government Association time to set up and then at 11 AM the fun begins. Students can show off their musical talents in band or solo performances, and various clubs sell food items, drinks, or other merchandise suchs as tshirts to fundraise. There are outdoor activities such as moon bounces or water balloon fights and indoor fun like video games and a board game room.</p>

<p>TJ TSA will be hosting a game room in Mr. Piccione's room (146). We plan on having four different set ups of either the Wii or Wii U playing Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart. We will fundraise by charging students based on time spent in the game room, charging 50&cent; for soda, and having several video game tournaments with seperate entry fees. There will be prizes for winners of the tournaments. Our fundraising goal for this event is about $400. Last year we had a booth that sold fried oreos, bannanas, donuts, and twinkies and we allowed students to bring other food items to us that they wanted to deep fry.</p>
