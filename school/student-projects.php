	<li><b>Echo Steganography</b> by Corwin de Boor (Microelectronics) <a href="http://echo.strikeskids.com/blog" target="_blank">[link]</a> - This project is concerned with a method of data hiding in audio that is undetectable both to the human ear and to a standard Fourier transform.</li>
	
    <li><b>Arbitrary-Constellation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</b> by Matthew Savage (Microelectronics) <a href="http://seniortech.bluepichu.com" target="_blank">[link]</a> - This project builds off of the standard encoding method used by Wifi, Bluetooth, and 4G to function with arbitrary data mappings, potentially allowing for optimizations beyond the current industry standard.</li>
