<h3>History</h3>

<p>In 1978, the American Industrial Arts Student Association (AIASA) separated from the American Industrial Arts Association, becoming financially independent and recognized as the official vocational student organization for industrial arts students. One year later, AIASA held its first national conference, separate from the AIAA.</p>

<p>In 1988, students voted to change AIASA's name to Technology Student Association (TSA), reflecting an expansion of focus from industrial arts to mainstream technology. The official logo was adopted in 1989. </p>

<p>Since then, TSA has drastically expanded, gaining membership, establishing new chapters all across the country. TSA has formed partnerships with such organizations as the American Cancer Society, the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association, Project Lead The Way, and VEX Robotics, and, through those partnerships, has launched STEM initiatives, including TEAMS (Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics and Science) and the Verizon Innovative App Challenge, in addition to the wide range of competitive events, showcased at annual conferences at local, state, and national levels.</p>

<p>Last year, 2013, marked TSA's 35th anniversary, and framed the largest national conference to date in Orlando, Florida. This year's national conference, to be hosted in Washington, D.C., promises to be even greater.</p>
